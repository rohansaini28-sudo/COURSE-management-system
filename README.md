Campus Course & Records Manager (CCRM)
Project Overview
This is a console-based Java SE application for managing academic records, including students, courses, enrollment, and grades. The application is built using a layered architecture to demonstrate advanced Java features.

How to Run
Prerequisites: Ensure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) [version used] installed.

Clone Repository:

Bash

git clone (https://github.com/rohansaini28-sudo/COURSE-management-system)
cd [project-folder-name]
Run (from command line, after compiling):

Bash

java -jar ccmr.jar
# OR (from IDE)
Run the main() method in the [YourMainClass] class.
